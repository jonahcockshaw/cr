                    The crime of high treason, for slandering or declaring war on one particular man and his family, carries with it a serious penalty.
                    <br></br>
                    This fact is a violation of the principle of the free speech that is the foundation of our entire democracy. 
                    <br></br>
                    The war that we are waging, therefore, is a war in defence of the ideas we hold dear.
                    <br></br>
                    It is a war in defence of the Declaration of Human Rights, wherein "all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights"; 
                    <br></br>
                    It should be expressed that this is not a violent war and we are not endorsing threats of physical violence to any individual.
                    <br></br>
                    On the contrary, this is a totally bloodless war waged by peaceful citizens who wish to promote equality and dignity for all, and who wish not to live in a country where some are born into "Highness" and others (presumably) into "Lowness" by some simple matter of birthright.
                    <br></br>
                    At the coronation of Charles Windsor on 6th May 2023, the Windsor family are encouraging the British public to swear allegiance to Charles and his heirs.
                    <br></br>
                    To combat this, and to protest against the ridiculous 'crime' of high treason that encompasses all manner of disloyalty to the Windsor family, we are responding to their desperate pleas for allegiance with our nonviolent declaration of ideological war. 
                    <br></br>
                    We hope that we will not be imprisoned for life for simply writing these words on the internet, saying them aloud, or writing them on placards. 
                    <br></br>
                    We also hope, however, that we might one day live in a society where certain individuals are not given special rights over and above any other individuals.
                    <br></br>
                    And that starts with abolishing the special rights and privileges of the Windsor family to command our speech and demand our allegiance.</p>
